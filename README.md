# Introduction

**swift-timeout** is a lightweight wrapper around [`Task`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task) that executes a closure with a given timeout.

# Installation

Timeout can be installed by using Swift Package Manager.

 **Note:** Timeout requires Swift 5.10 on Xcode 15.4+. It runs on iOS 13+, tvOS 13+, macOS 10.15+, Linux and Windows.
To install using Swift Package Manager, add this to the `dependencies:` section in your Package.swift file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/swhitty/swift-timeout.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.2.0"))
```

# Usage

Usage is similar to using structured concurrency:

```swift
import Timeout

let val = try await withThrowingTimeout(seconds: 1.5) {
  try await perform()
}
```

If the timeout expires before a value is returned the task is cancelled and `TimeoutError` is thrown.

# Credits

Timeout is primarily the work of [Simon Whitty](https://github.com/swhitty).
